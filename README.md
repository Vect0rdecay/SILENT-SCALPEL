Project Silent Scalpel is a series documenting my research journey into computational graphs starting with ONNX, my thought process, my failures, the iterations, and the unexpected discoveries.

This research was done independently outside of work on personal time, using all my own hardware, software and AI-assisted development R&D resources. Any conclusions or views expressed herein are my own and do not reflect those of my employer.
